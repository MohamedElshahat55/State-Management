# What is State-Management and Why You Should Learn It?


> Before getting into the state-management it is important to know that what is state? If we understand the concept of state, then it will become quite easy to understand the Management of the State and How we can do that as well.

## What is state in react?

In React, "state" refers to an **_object_** that represents the internal state of a component, such as the list of customers, list of products coming from a database is a type of state, The state of a component can change over time, and when it does, the component is re-rendered to reflect the new state.

The state is used to store data that can change in response to user actions or other events, such as a button click, a form submission, or a network request. By managing the state of a component, React makes it easy to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces.

## Why do you need React state management?

React applications are built using components and they manage their state internally and it works well for applications with few components, but when the application grows bigger, the complexity of managing states shared across components becomes difficult.

**For example**, consider a form in a React application. The user inputs some data into the form, which is then stored in the state of the component. The user can make changes to the data and submit the form multiple times, and each time the state of the component is updated to reflect the new data.

Without state management, it would be difficult to keep track of the user's input and update the UI accordingly. By managing the state of the component, React provides a way to handle these changes and update the UI in real-time.

## When i have to use the state management?

> You should consider using state management in React when:

1. Your application has complex data that needs to be shared between multiple components.
2. Your application has a lot of state that needs to be managed across different components.
3. Your application needs to handle user interactions that require state updates, such as form submissions, button clicks, or network requests.

Your application needs to handle real-time updates and respond to changes in the data.
In general, if your application is small and has simple state management needs, you can use the built-in state object of React components to manage the state. However, if your application is larger and has more complex state management needs, you may want to consider using a more advanced state management solution like **Redux or MobX**.

It's important to note that choosing the right state management solution depends on the specific requirements of your project. You should consider factors such as the complexity of your application, the amount of state you need to manage, and the scalability of the solution.

## Types of state in React

> In React, there are two main types of state: local state and global state.

**Local State**: Local state is state that is managed within **_a single component_**. It is used to store data that is specific to that component and does not need to be shared with other components. Local state can be created and managed using the `useState `hook in functional components.

```import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  function handleClick() {
    setCount(count + 1);
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```

in this example, the `useState` hook is used to create a local state variable called count with an initial value of 0. The `setCount` function is used to update the count value when the button is clicked.

When the button is clicked, the `handleClick` function is called, which updates the count value using the `setCount` function. This triggers a re-render of the component, and the updated count value is displayed on the page.

**Global State**: Global state is state that is shared between **_multiple components_** in an application.
   It is used to store data that needs to be accessed and updated by different components.
   Global state can be managed using state management libraries like Redux, MobX, or the React Context API.

here's an example of global state management in React using the Context API:

###Global State Management with React Context API

In this example, we will create a simple React application that uses the Context API to manage global state.

### Setup

First, create a new React application using create-react-app:

```
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app

```

### Creating the Global State

Create a new file called GlobalState.js in the src directory. This file will contain the code for creating and managing the global state.

```
import React, { createContext, useState } from 'react';

// Create a new context object

export const GlobalContext = createContext();

// Create a provider component to wrap the app

export const GlobalProvider = ({ children }) => {

  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const incrementCount = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  const decrementCount = () => {
    setCount(count - 1);
  };

  // Define the context value

  const contextValue = {

    count,
    incrementCount,
    decrementCount,

  }};

  // Render the provider with the context value and children
  return (
    <GlobalContext.Provider value={contextValue}>
      {children}
    </GlobalContext>  Accessing the Global State
  )

  // Now that we have created the global state and provider, we can access the state in our components using the `useContext` hook.


import React, { useContext } from 'react';
import { GlobalContext } from './GlobalState';

function Counter() {
  const { count, incrementCount, decrementCount } = useContext(GlobalContext);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={incrementCount}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={decrementCount}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```

In this example, we use the `useContext` hook to access the count, incrementCount, and decrementCount values from the global state.

When the incrementCount function is called, the count value in the global state is incremented, and the UI is updated to reflect the new value. Similarly, when the decrementCount function is called, the count value in the global state is decremented, and the UI is updated.

> In addition to avoiding **props drilling**, the Context API offers several other benefits for global state management in React:

1. **Simpler code:** Using the Context API can make your code simpler and easier to read, as you don't need to pass props down through multiple layers of components. This can reduce the complexity of your code and make it easier to maintain.

2. **Performance optimization:** The Context API can help optimize the performance of your application by reducing the number of re-renders caused by prop changes. When a component consumes context, it only re-renders when the relevant context value changes, rather than when any prop changes.

3. **Centralized state management:** The Context API provides a centralized way to manage state in your application. By creating a single context object that contains all the relevant state, you can more easily keep track of and update the state of your application.

4. **Ease of use:** The Context API is built into React, so there is no need to install any additional libraries or dependencies. This can make it easier to get started with global state management in your React application.

Overall, the Context API provides a powerful and flexible way to manage global state in your React application, offering several benefits over traditional prop drilling.
